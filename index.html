	<h1> Seeing Networks in Wellington </h1>
	<p> Wellingtons network infrastructure contains a variety of networks from
	 what i witnessed when exploring Wellington i noticed two areas which are
	Public Transport systems and Powerlines and Secruity Cameras which i found to
	be both common and important in wellington as they are constantly being used
	alot by citizens in wellington in day to day life as these networks have alot
	of positive impact on us in our day to day lives</p>
